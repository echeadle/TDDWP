This is code is found in the book "Test-Driven Development with Python"; ISBN 978-1-449-36482-3.  

This is the best book on programming I have found and recommend buying the book in order to encourage Harry 
to write more books like this one.

I suggest people buy the book and download/fork the code from the author's (Harry J.W. Percival) site.

This repository has some issues. It is not a fork of the code found on the author's git hub site;
the chapters are not separate branches, and there are artifacts and mistakes that come from learning
and typing in each line of code.
